Hebbian Neural Network

* Free software: ISC license
* Documentation: https://hnn.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Everything

Some ideas we were talking about:

    1) Dopamine is globally applied and strengthens Hebbian connections that have been recently potentiated
    2) Neurons require a baseline firing rate to create tenuous Hebbian connections that can be reenforced when the right network forms
    3) If a connection is 0 weighted, hebbian learning cannot take place (this allows genes to provide structure)
    4) Not connecting is more powerful than connecting. This provides regularization.
