# Hebbian Neural Network

Some ideas we were talking about:

1) Dopamine is globally applied and strengthens Hebbian connections that have been recently potentiated
2) Neurons require a baseline firing rate to create tenuous Hebbian connections that can be reenforced when the right network forms
3) If a connection is 0 weighted, hebbian learning cannot take place (this allows genes to provide structure)
4) Not connecting is more powerful than connecting. This provides regularization.
